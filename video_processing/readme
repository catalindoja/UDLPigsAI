convert video to frames use:used for code block executions.

python3 convert_video_to_frames.py ./input/C1_29-3.mp4 ./output/ 60

first parameter (./input/*) is the input video to be processed.
second parameter (./output/) is the folder where the frames will be stored.
third parameter (number) is the frames to be skipped every iteration. For example in a 60 frames per second video
60 means that the program will get a frame every second.


laplacian blur filter use:

python3 laplacian_blur_filter.py ./output/ 120

first parameter (./output/) is the folder where the images to be analysed are
second paramater (float) is used as a value for the threshold of the laplacian focal measure.
Any image bellow that value will be deleted.

The program will take the given folder and it will cycle through the images in it to apply the laplacian filter.
If the image is considered blurry by the image, then it will be deleted from the folder.


image difference use:

python3 image_difference.py ./output/ 0.8
first parameter (./output/) is the folder where the images to be analysed are
second paramater (float) is used as a value for the threshold of the similarity score index.
Any image with a similarity index over the threshold will be deleted.

The program will take the given folder and it will cycle through the images. It will take an image and compare it against
all other images and delete the images that go over the treshold. Then it will take the next image and do this process until
all images have been analyzed.
